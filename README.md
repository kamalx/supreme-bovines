Cows and Bulls is a game...

This project uses react + vite.

This was an learning experiment that has so far gone pretty good.
It includes a react app started from scratch using one of the pnpm
create commands for react projects that I am forgetting...

Ref:
This project was an experiment with deepseek, and it was a delightful experience
of discovering something I was unfamiliar with with the help of a new opensource
ai model that I was trying out.

The conversation in which deepseek helped me write this code is linked below for
my future reference:
